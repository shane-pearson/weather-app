<!-- Finished Project -->

<!-- Deployed site: https://shane-pearson.github.io/password-generator/ -->

Installation: First I had to build the late out of my website. I did this by working in bootstrap and CSS. I build a clean a simple header using CSS and adding a gradient. I used bootstrap to insert a search bar, and button. Finally I build multiple containers to house the information returned from the api. 

Usage: This app should be a quick way to search for weather. Save your results, adn revisit in the future. 

Credits: I watched multiple tutorials to help with this project, and also refereed to class lessons.
